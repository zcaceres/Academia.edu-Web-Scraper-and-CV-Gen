<p><em>Biography</em>:
I am an environmental anthropologist/archaeologist, an ethnobotanist/paleoethnobotanist, and a landscape/household archaeologist. Regionally, the vast majority of my work as an anthropological archaeologist occurs in Mesoamerica. Sub-regionally, I have conducted research in the Maya Lowlands of Belize, Yucatan, and Guatemala, and I have been working intensively in the Basin of Mexico over the past several years. Conceptually, much of my research centers on questions of inequality and ideology. I have studied the impact of state power on agrarian landscapes, the connection between politics and environmental sustainability, the integration of ritual with politics, community formation in the wake of imperial collapse, the effect of economic circumstances on gender relations, the role of archaeological narratives in contemporary identity politics, and several other anthropological issues. I am presently the principal investigator and field director of the Northern Basin of Mexico Historical Ecology Project, a multi-sited, multi-period project that is conducting research in Xaltocan, Jaltenco-Nextalalpan, Zumpango, Apaxco, and Tequixquiac, Mexico.less</p>

<h3>Title: Let the earth forever remain! Landscape legacies and the materiality of history in the northern Basin of Mexico</h3>
<h4>Abstract:</h4><p>This article examines the landscape as an enduring protagonist in the northern Basin of Mexico over the past 1,000 years in communities north of Mexico City. Viewing materiality as the mutual constitution between social and physical worlds, I discuss the production and inheritance of landscape legacies. The manner in which legacies are inherited is tied to changing political, economic, and social conditions. This project integrates multiple sources of information (archaeological, ethnographic, historical, and ecological) to understand transforming connections between people and the landscape in this region, from the ancient state of Xaltocan to the Aztec and Spanish empires, continuing into the struggle for a modern nation. It reveals relationships that are apparent only via a perspective in dialogue with the landscape's materiality over time. In so doing, this article asserts archaeologists' unique contribution to the study of not only long-term change but also historical processes inherited by and relevant to the contemporary world.</p>

<h3>Title: Monitoring cultural landscapes from space: Evaluating archaeological sites in the Basin of Mexico using very high resolution satellite imagery</h3>
<h4>Abstract:</h4><p>Satellite data allow archaeologists to not only identify archaeological sites and features but to monitor them in relation to contemporary landscape changes. This article pursues this goal by assessing the contemporary conditions of archaeological sites originally recorded over 40 years ago in the northern Basin of Mexico. We examine archaeological site locations and 1970s land-use data recorded by surveyors against contemporary land-use information observable in very high resolution (VHR) GeoEye-1 multi-spectral satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate continuity in the types of land classes within which sites existed during the 1970s and today, but they also show significant changes with potentially negative impacts on the preservation of cultural resources. Most sites in agro-pastoral lands over 40 years ago remain in agro-pastoral land. However, the expansion of modern settlements due to population growth and changing property laws has encroached on archaeological sites. Technological intensification of agricultural practices (i.e., tractors) can impact site preservation even if the landuse category remained unchanged. This article also discusses the potential impact that different settlement types, de-positional environments, and looting can have on cultural resources and outlines key areas of future research requiring the integration of remote sensing and archaeological fieldwork.</p>
