<h3>Title: _Don Quixote_: Pioneer of Religious Freedom. LEARN LIBERTY. 18 June 2016.</h3>
<h4>Abstract:</h4><p>Was _Don Quixote_ a pioneer of religious freedom?  Eric C. Graf, Professor of Literature at Universidad Francisco Marroquín, explains how Miguel de Cervantes used his novel _Don Quixote_ to illustrate the negative consequences of censoring speech and religion. Do you agree with Cervantes’s argument that individuals should be left alone to have freedom of conscience? Or are there some ideas that are too dangerous for individuals to access?</p>

<h3>Title: A Novel Without Boundaries Sensing Don Quixote 400 Years Later</h3>
<h4>Abstract:</h4><p>This volume of essays by new and established figures in its field will
appeal to scholars in disciplines such as literature, drama, history, and
cultural studies. It offers ten fresh perspectives on Miguel de Cervantes’s Don Quixote 400 years after the publication of its Second Part and consists of two sections. The first group of articles examines meta-readings and visual elements of the masterpiece in relation to some major literary forms and genres—such as novels of chivalry, the Alexandrian epic narrative and the genesis of detective fiction—, all of which contributed to the creation and maintenance of a quixotic tradition in Western writing. The second set of essays explores the transformation of the novel in various linguistic, generic and sociopolitical contexts
and formats, from Spanish royal festivities, foreign translations and chapbooks to macroeconomics and Latin American street theater.</p>

<h3>Title: CERVANTES AND MODERNITY: FOUR ESSAYS ON _DON QUIJOTE_. Bucknell UP, 2007. (Kindle edition, $5.99)</h3>
<h4>Abstract:</h4><p>Graf argues that the doubts expressed by both historicists and postmodernists regarding the progressive nature of _Don Quijote_ are exaggerated. He also argues that interpretations that abstain from this debate by emphasizing authorial ambivalence or positioning the novel at a crossroads do not seem as responsible as they once did. Beyond these skeptical and neutral alternatives, there are key steps forward in Cervantes's worldview. These four essays detail _Don Quijote_'s anticipations of many of the same ideas and values that drive today's multiculturalism, feminism, secularism, and materialism. An important thesis here is that the Enlightenment remains the best vantage point from which to appreciate the novel's relation to the discourses of such movements. Thus Voltaire's _Candide_ (1759), Feijoo's "Defensa de las mujeres" (1726), and Hobbes's _Leviathan_ (1651) are each shown to be logical extensions of some of Cervantes's most fundamental propositions. Finally, this book will still be of interest to specialists immune to the ideological anxieties arising from debates over notions of modernity. Graf also explores the interrelated meaning of a number of _Don Quijote_'s symbols, characters, and episodes, pinpoints several of the novel's most important classical and medieval sources, and unveils for us its first serious English reader.</p>
